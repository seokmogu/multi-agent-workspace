## When to Use This Skill

### Perfect For:
- Starting new features or epics
- Sprint planning sessions
- Creating comprehensive Jira ticket structures
- Onboarding new features with full documentation
- Ensuring traceability from requirements to implementation

### Not Suitable For:
- Quick bug fixes (just create a ticket directly)
- Documentation-only tasks
- Simple one-off tasks that don't need decomposition

## Prerequisites

### Required Setup

**1. Jira MCP Server**

This skill requires a Jira MCP server. We recommend `@orengrinker/jira-mcp-server`.

See `SETUP.md` in this skill directory for complete installation guide.

Quick check if installed:
```bash
# Skill will automatically check and guide you if not set up
```

**2. Project Information**

You'll need to know:
- Jira Project Key (e.g., "PROJ")
- Project name
- Team member names for task assignment

## Interactive Workflow

When you invoke this skill, I'll guide you through a conversational process:

### Phase 1: PRD Creation

I'll ask you targeted questions to build a comprehensive PRD:

```
AI: Let's create a PRD for your feature. I'll ask some questions.

Q1: What problem are you solving?
    ‚Üí User's pain point
    ‚Üí Current workarounds
    ‚Üí Who is affected

Q2: What are your success metrics?
    ‚Üí How will you measure success?
    ‚Üí Target KPIs (e.g., "30% faster checkout")
    ‚Üí Timeline for measuring

Q3: Who are your users?
    ‚Üí B2B or B2C?
    ‚Üí Primary and secondary personas
    ‚Üí Use cases

Q4: What's in scope for MVP?
    ‚Üí Must-have features
    ‚Üí Nice-to-have (future)
    ‚Üí Explicit non-goals

Q5: Any constraints or dependencies?
    ‚Üí Technical limitations
    ‚Üí Timeline requirements
    ‚Üí Team dependencies
```

**Output**: `docs/prd/{feature-name}-{date}.md`

### Phase 2: Jira Epic Creation

```
AI: Great! Now let's create a Jira Epic.

   PRD Summary:
   - Feature: OAuth Authentication
   - Goal: 30% reduction in signup friction
   - Scope: Google + GitHub OAuth

   I'll create an Epic ticket with:
   - Title: "OAuth Authentication Integration"
   - Description: [Summary from PRD]
   - PRD Link: docs/prd/oauth-authentication-2024-10.md
   - Labels: authentication, oauth
   - Project: PROJ

   Proceed? (Y/n)
```

**If Jira MCP not configured**: I'll provide setup instructions and pause.

**Output**: Epic ticket (e.g., `PROJ-123`)

### Phase 3: Feature Decomposition

```
AI: Let's break this Epic into User Stories.

   Based on your PRD, I suggest 3 Stories:

   Story 1: Google OAuth Integration
   - Implement Google OAuth 2.0 flow
   - User can sign up/login with Google
   - Priority: High
   - Estimate: 8 points

   Story 2: GitHub OAuth Integration
   - Implement GitHub OAuth flow
   - User can sign up/login with GitHub
   - Priority: High
   - Estimate: 5 points

   Story 3: Account Linking for Existing Users
   - Allow existing users to link OAuth accounts
   - Merge accounts on OAuth login
   - Priority: Medium
   - Estimate: 5 points

   Total: 18 story points

   Would you like to:
   - Adjust priorities?
   - Split/merge stories?
   - Add more stories?
   - Proceed as-is?
```

### Phase 4: User Story Generation

For each approved story:

```
AI: Creating Story 1/3: Google OAuth Integration

   User Story:
   As a new user
   I want to sign up using my Google account
   So that I can quickly create an account without filling forms

   Acceptance Criteria:
   AC-1: OAuth Flow
   Given a user on the signup page
   When they click "Sign up with Google"
   Then they should be redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
   And after approval, redirected back to the app
   And their account should be created with Google email

   AC-2: Login with Existing Google Account
   Given a user with a Google-linked account
   When they click "Login with Google" and approve
   Then they should be logged in automatically

   AC-3: Error Handling
   Given Google OAuth fails (user denies, network error)
   When the OAuth flow is interrupted
   Then the user should see a clear error message
   And be able to retry or use alternative signup

   Story Points: 8
   Link to Epic: PROJ-123

   Create this Story ticket? (Y/n)
```

**Output**: User Story tickets (e.g., `PROJ-124`, `PROJ-125`, `PROJ-126`)

### Phase 5: Implementation Tasks

For each User Story:

```
AI: Creating Tasks for Story PROJ-124: Google OAuth Integration

   Backend Tasks:
   PROJ-127: Set up Google OAuth credentials
   - Create Google Cloud project
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Get client ID and secret
   Assigned to: [Backend dev name]
   Estimate: 2 hours

   PROJ-128: Implement OAuth callback endpoint
   - Create /auth/google/callback route
   - Exchange code for tokens
   - Create or link user account
   Assigned to: [Backend dev name]
   Estimate: 4 hours

   Frontend Tasks:
   PROJ-129: Add "Sign up with Google" button
   - Design button component
   - Integrate Google OAuth library
   - Handle redirect flow
   Assigned to: [Frontend dev name]
   Estimate: 2 hours

   PROJ-130: Error handling and loading states
   - Show loading during OAuth flow
   - Display error messages
   - Retry mechanism
   Assigned to: [Frontend dev name]
   Estimate: 2 hours

   QA Tasks:
   PROJ-131: Test Google OAuth flows
   - Test Case 1: Successful signup
   - Test Case 2: Successful login
   - Test Case 3: Error scenarios
   - Test Case 4: Account linking
   Assigned to: [QA name]
   Estimate: 3 hours

   Who should I assign these tasks to?
```

**Output**: Implementation Task tickets (e.g., `PROJ-127` through `PROJ-131`)

### Phase 6: Progress Tracking

```
AI: Epic PROJ-123 is now set up!

   üìä Summary:
   - Epic: PROJ-123 (OAuth Authentication)
   - User Stories: 3 (PROJ-124, 125, 126)

## Best Practices

### When Creating PRDs
1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Don't assume requirements
2. **Define metrics early** - How will you know it's successful?
3. **Keep scope realistic** - MVP mindset
4. **Link to user research** - Real user needs, not assumptions

### When Creating Stories
1. **Keep atomic** - One story = one vertical slice
2. **Make AC testable** - QA can verify without asking
3. **Include context** - Link to PRD for "why"
4. **Estimate realistically** - 1-8 points ideal (larger = split)

### When Creating Tasks
1. **Break down by discipline** - Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps
2. **Make tasks < 1 day** - 2-6 hours ideal
3. **Clear ownership** - One assignee per task
4. **Dependencies explicit** - Block/blocked-by relationships

### Documentation
1. **Living documents** - Update PRD as you learn
2. **Link everything** - PRD ‚Üî Epic ‚Üî Story ‚Üî Task ‚Üî PR
3. **Version control** - Store PRDs in git
4. **Team access** - Ensure everyone can access docs

## Jira MCP Integration

This skill uses Jira MCP to:
- ‚úÖ Create Epic tickets
- ‚úÖ Create User Story tickets
- ‚úÖ Create Task tickets (subtasks)
- ‚úÖ Link tickets (Epic ‚Üí Story, Story ‚Üí Task)
- ‚úÖ Assign tickets to team members
- ‚úÖ Search tickets by JQL
- ‚úÖ Update ticket status
- ‚úÖ Add comments to tickets

### Available Jira Operations

```typescript
// Epic Creation
create_issue({
  project: "PROJ",
  issuetype: "Epic",
  summary: "Feature Name",
  description: "...",
  customFields: {
    epicName: "Feature Name"
  }
})

// User Story Creation
create_issue({

  outwardIssue: "PROJ-123",
  type: "relates to"
})

// Search
search_issues({
  jql: "project = PROJ AND epic = PROJ-123"
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Jira MCP Not Connected

```
Error: Jira MCP server not available

Solution:
1. Check that Jira MCP is configured in your MCP settings
2. Verify your API token is valid
3. See SETUP.md for configuration guide
```

### Epic Creation Failed

```
Error: Cannot create Epic - custom field not found

Solution:
1. Verify your Jira project supports Epic issue type
2. Check that epic name custom field exists
3. Try creating a regular Issue type instead
```

### Story Points Not Showing

```
Issue: Story points field not available

Solution:
Story points may be a custom field in your Jira.
I'll ask for the custom field ID during setup.
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Workflows

You can customize the workflow:

```
User: "Use our team's workflow: Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Task"

AI: Noted! I'll use:
   - Epic (instead of Epic)
   - Feature (instead of User Story)
   - Task (same)
```

### Integration with GitHub

```
User: "Link PRs to tasks automatically"

AI: I can add GitHub PR links to tasks when PRs are created.
   Set up GitHub MCP for automatic linking.
```

### Sprint Auto-Planning

```
User: "Auto-assign stories to next sprint"

AI: I'll analyze team velocity and automatically:
   - Calculate available capacity
   - Prioritize stories
   - Assign to sprint
   - Notify team
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Authentication Feature
