      "Add payment processing with Stripe"

AI: [Interactive session]
    ... Q&A for PRD ...

    âœ… PRD Created: docs/prd/payment-processing-2024-10.md
    âœ… Epic Created: PROJ-200
    âœ… Stories Created: 4 stories (22 story points)
    âœ… Tasks Created: 16 tasks assigned to team

    Ready for sprint planning!
```

### Example 2: Progress Tracking

```
User: /skill agile-master
      "Track PROJ-200"

AI: Epic: Payment Processing (PROJ-200)
    Status: In Progress (65% complete)

    ðŸš§ In Progress: 1/4 stories
    ðŸ“‹ To Do: 1/4 stories

## Best Practices

1. **Start with PRD** - Don't skip the "why"
2. **Keep Stories Small** - 1-8 story points
3. **Clear AC** - Testable, specific criteria
4. **Link Everything** - PRD â†” Epic â†” Story â†” Task
5. **Update as You Learn** - PRD is a living document

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Jira MCP not available"
- **Fix**: See SETUP.md for configuration

**Issue**: "Cannot create Epic"
- **Fix**: Check Jira project has Epic issue type enabled

**Issue**: "Story points not showing"
- **Fix**: Configure custom field ID (I'll ask during setup)
